# High Level Description
Carigslist is a website to support a platform for buying and selling used automobiles. As a seller, you will be able to get analytics of recent prices of sold cars to better understand what value your vehicle should be listed for. Each listing will have the ability to show seller ratings, comments, and discussions link to aid in showing why this model of car is a great buy. 

As a buyer, Carigslist will have those same price points to give you a basis on what to expect for the desired make and model, and allow visualization of price trends using Recharts with data sourced from APIs like the DOT or Kelly Blue Book. The best part of using Carigslist is it removes the need to go to a Car dealer which will try and upsell you on everything!
